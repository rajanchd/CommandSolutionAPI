Track and Commit Your Files
OK, we want to track “everything” (except those files ignored!); to do so, type (ensure you
put the trailing period “.”)

git add .
git status
git commit -m "Initial Commit"

These files are being tracked and are “staged” for commit.
Finally, we want to “commit” the changes (essentially lock them in)
This commits the code with a note (or “message”; hence the -m switch) about that
particular commit. 

git add .
git commit -m “Added Command Model to API Project”
git push origin master


Before we finish here though, remember to save everything and (ensuring you’re in
the main solution folder CommandAPISolution):
• git add .
•git commit -m “Added Model and Mock Repository”
•git push origin master
